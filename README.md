Mileage Calculator is used to calculate mileage of vehicles which have an indicator to show distance driven with the main tank and the reserve tanks separately.
=======
Say for e.g. a vehicle has 10 litres of fuel capacity of which main tank is of 8 litres an dreserve tank is of 2 litres.
The indicator must show the distance driven using main and reserve fuel.
Also the quantitity of fuel filled must be known for the calculation.
Using these values at the time of refilling the vehicle at two subsequent times we can calculate the mileage (distance driven per litre of fuel)

___Things to know___
  - odometer readings during two subsequent fuellings.
  - quantity of fuel filled.

Formula to calculate the mileage is fairly simple.
===
To subtract the odometer readings , then add the first reserve tank consumption and subtract from it the second reserve consumption
